#TODO create an algorithm that you want the robot the follow
#PS That should go in a seperate file

#Things you may want for an algorithm:
    #Choose a space to move to and add it to the stack. repeat.
    #If no more moves possible and not all snacks eaten pop the stack and try a different move
    #If no valid move keep popping until there is
    #When complete the stack will be the path taken
